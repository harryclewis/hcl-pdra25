# PDRA Tools (2025)
This library contains common functions for my space physics research, primarily designed for Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data obtained from the [AMDA](https://amda.irap.omp.eu/) database via [SciQLop/Speasy](https://github.com/SciQLop/speasy). Various plotting, science, and utility functions are also included.
