# PDRA Tools (2025)
This library contains common data and plotting routines for my space physics research, primarily designed for Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data obtained from the [AMDA](https://amda.irap.omp.eu/) database via [SciQLop/Speasy](https://github.com/SciQLop/speasy).

In addition, there are some routines to process and display remote sensing image data from PSP and Solar Orbiter. These need to be executed using an environment with the [SunPy](https://sunpy.org/) package, and its dependencies.

# Installation
This package is quite specialised, so it is not currently available to download through pip. Here is a suggested installation process:
1. Download the repository as a .zip file
2. Extract to a folder of your choice
3. Open your terminal at the the extracted folder
4. Activate your chosen virtual environment
5. Execute `pip install -e .`

This will install an editable version of the `hcl_pdra25` package to your chosen environment. Other installation methods should work but have not been tested.

Note: By default, the package will not install requirements for the `remote.py` functions.
